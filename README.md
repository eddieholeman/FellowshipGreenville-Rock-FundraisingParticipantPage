# FellowshipGreenville-Rock-FundraisingParticipantPage
Development of the participants' fundraising feature in Rock

Project #1
11/1/2017 Outreach has requested an enhanced progress bar on the participants page which includes Goal, Contributions to date and Remaining. a link to a contributor list.  Included in this project is the modified FundraisingParticipantProgress.Lava template as well as the [dbo].[custFundraising_Participant_ContributorList] stored procedure used on the Dynamic Data block of the contribution list page.

Project #2
12/15/2017 Outreach has several documents already prepared that they would like to have available for all team leaders and members in a "toolbox." We used to have something like this in Arena. Jana is the contact person. The project was the adding of a group attribute called Trip Documents Link for the GroupType Fundraising Opportunity.  This attribute will be used by Outreach to provide the URL to a Google Drive folder containing participant documents for this trip.  The FundraisingParticipantProgress.Lava template was modified to provide this link to the participant via the Participant Page.
